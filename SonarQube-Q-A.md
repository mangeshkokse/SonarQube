## Q. What is SonarQube?
- ***SonarQube*** is an open-source platform for continuous code quality inspection. It analyzes source code to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and security issues, helping developers maintain high-quality and secure code.

# Key Features of SonarQube

 **Code Quality Analysis** – Identifies bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.  
 **Supports Multiple Languages** – Works with Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, Go, Kubernetes YAML, and more.  
 **Static Code Analysis** – Scans the source code without execution.  
 **Security Scanning** – Detects security flaws like SQL injection, XSS, and hardcoded credentials.  
 **Integration with CI/CD** – Works with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, Azure DevOps, etc.  
 **Quality Gates** – Blocks builds if the code doesn’t meet quality standards.  
 **Dashboard & Reports** – Provides detailed reports on technical debt, maintainability, and test coverage.
